### Domains for each case
# Import first init time for each case
# Load the lat/lon .npy files for d01, d02.

### CAPE/shear for each case
# Top-down graphs of max from SPC mesoanal?
# Bar graph inset somewhere?

### Performance diagram for point-to-point
# QPF and cref


### CRPS of QPF/cref



#### eFSS compare 3km/1km
# Do over a lot of scales to check generality
# Select about 5 good scales to overlap
# Need to include 1 km "off the edge" of 3 km eFSS
# Do 1-, 3-, 5-step for time windows

### eSAL for 1km and 3 km

##### OBJECT ID ######
### Do object ID for cref (obs and sim) and w (forecast)


# Performance diagram of object cref


# CRPS of cref? Look at eSAL


### Max W of all objects


### Waffleplot of matched differences in W, cref...
# The fill of the square is the difference
# Colour so it's negative or positive, and the colour depth is how far
# Order it so it's "predictive power" of 3 v 1 km.

### Case study 
# 500/925 heights, ~sfc fronts (Python!), auto front detection?!
# CAPE/shear
# forecast v observed rotation, cref, precip, W?


### SCHEMATIC
# PMM 'average object' for each domain?
# Pick the object that has the closest to the average for each domain, for one case?
